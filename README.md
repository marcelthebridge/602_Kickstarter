# Kickstarter Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling
This project was an exervise in machine learning principles.

## Overview
Kickstarter is a crowdsourcing venture that seeks to empower individuals and groups worldwide.  
There have been some incredible success stories such as:
- [Pebble Time smartwatch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises)
  - Earned over $20 million in funding, with other 2 million devices shipped. 
  - Sadly no longer a company.  I guess popularity does not ensure success. The company was sold, and funds for the Pebble 2 were returned.
- [Travel Jacket](https://www.baubax.com/)
  - Earned $9 million in funding.
  - Perhaps the dorkiest item in existence, the jacket boasted pockets for every gadget and device you could imagine.  It also had built in gloves AND a neck pillow.
- [Exploding Kittens](https://explodingkittens.com/)
  - Just shy of $9 million in funding
  - I have seen this game on almost every friend or family members bookshelf I can remember.
